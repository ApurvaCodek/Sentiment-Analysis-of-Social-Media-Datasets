This project presents an efficient approach to address the problem of effective sentiment analysis via Naive Bayes Classifier. The developed approach exploits a number of feature extraction techniques, N-grams, filtering stop words and bag of words as well as several preprocessing stages. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed approach, two different corpus datasets were deployed where the first corpus, well known SemEval 2014 and second corpus, Sanders twitter sentiment analysis corpus. The developed system achieves comparable results in the criteria of accuracy, F-Score, precision and recall over training and test data set.
